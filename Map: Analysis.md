### Map: Analysis

Over the last 8 years, I've experimented with a few different maps to try and visualize African American lecturing tours in Britain and Ireland. (Thanks to Mike Gardner, Uni of Nottingham who has been instrumental in guiding me through this.)

In 2020, I've created a few maps in Carto. While the majority of people I speak to prefer my older maps, with the specific number of lectures in a region and the venue/date info, I still think these Carto maps are really interesting and can give us a fresh perspective on their travels, their routes of transportation, and how far they travelled. See below:

The next map shows the following individuals: (Frederick Douglass, James Watkins, Moses Roper, William and Ellen Craft, Josiah Henson, Benjamin William and Jane Brown, and Ida B. Wells:

Carto has been really useful for creating a map over time: below, you'll see an animated graphic of the number of lectures between 1837 and 1900 by 26 African Americans. Each coloured dot represents a particular person, so the green dots are Moses Roper and the purple dots are James Watkins. While the majority of African Americans travelled to Britain and Ireland in the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s, they continued to lecture in the British Isles long after slavery was legally abolished in 1865. They spoke about segregation, racism, Jim Crow laws, lynching, white domestic terrorism and tried to convince the transatlantic public that, in the words of Bishop Walter Hawkins in 1891, "slavery was not dead. It is alive at this very moment."

Using Carto, I've also created a heat map, showing how lectures were often concentrated in London, the Midlands and parts of Scotland.

We can use Carto to compare journeys. See below for a comparison between James Watkins (purple) and Moses Roper (green). While experimenting with this map, I filtered the data to view dates, locations and venues - however, there are 100s of locations listed by both Watkins and Roper in their respective narratives that don't give specifics in regard to date and venue, which makes a visual analysis somewhat more complicated! Watkins has the highest number of locations (1,110) but he spoke in the same locations several times and stuck close to the Midlands. Roper on the other hand, travelled very widely - from Penzance to Inverness.
