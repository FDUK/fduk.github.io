### Teaching Resources

Since I began studying Black abolitionism in the British Isles back in 2012, I’ve designed numerous teaching resources for both primary and secondary schools. Over the years, I’ve taught in several schools in Nottingham and in Southampton. 

Check back soon for these revised and updated teaching resources, which I will publish here over the course of 2020.
