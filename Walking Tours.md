### Walking Tours

As my research into Black abolitionism grows, I have collected sites of importance where women and men spoke about slavery, racial injustice, lynching, temperance and suffrage. These locations have led to the digital maps on this website, but they have also provided information for walking tours that I have created and organise on a semi-regular basis. 

Check out my separate website for dates and times to book - https://blackabolitionistwalkingtours.wordpress.com
