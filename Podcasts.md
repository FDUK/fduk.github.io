### Podcast Series (TBC!)

In 2020 as part of my EC Leverhulme Fellowship, I am planning a podcast series focusing on the experiences of Black Abolitionists in the British Isles, including their impact on the nation and their writings and speeches, together with debates and discussions on public engagement with experts in the field. Stay tuned!
