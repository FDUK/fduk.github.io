### Walking Tours

As my research into Black abolitionism grows, I have collated numerous locations where Black freedom fighters lectured about slavery, racial injustice, lynching, temperance and suffrage. These locations have led to the digital maps on this website, but they have also provided information for walking tours that I have created and organise on a semi-regular basis. 

Check out my separate [website](https://blackabolitionistwalkingtours.wordpress.com) or see the following four links to the virtual tours I organise. Tickets are donation only and the tours usually begin 530pm-6pm British time. Feel free to get in touch if you would like to ask about in-person, private or corporate tours!
