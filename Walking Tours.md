### Walking Tours

As my research into Black abolitionism grows, I have collected sites of importance where women and men spoke about slavery, racial injustice, lynching, temperance and suffrage. These locations have led to the digital maps on this website, but they have also provided information for walking tours that I have created and organise on a semi-regular basis. 

Check out my separate [website](https://blackabolitionistwalkingtours.wordpress.com) for dates to book or use this link to book VIRTUAL walking tours during COVID-19: [here](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/virtual-black-abolitionist-tour-of-london-tickets-105940980324)

All of the tours I lead are free, but if you have enjoyed the tour, and would like to make a donation to my travel expenses down to London (I live in Nottingham) then I would very much appreciate it!
