### Teaching Resources

Since I began studying Black abolitionism in the British Isles back in 2012, I’ve designed numerous teaching resources for both primary and secondary schools. Over the years, I’ve taught in several schools in Nottingham and in Southampton. 

Check back soon for these revised and updated teaching resources, which I will publish here over the course of 2020.

In the meantime, check out this word cloud: using 600 pages of transcribed Black Abolitionist speeches, it identifies the key words/phrases they used in their lectures from the 1830s to the 1890s. It really highlights their radicalism and expressions of freedom, and can be a great teaching tool for secondary schools to Universities!
