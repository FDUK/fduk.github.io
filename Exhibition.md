### Exhibition (TBC!)

In 2022, as part of my Early Career Leverhulme Fellowship, I am planning an exhibition focusing on Black Abolitionist tours within the British Isles. Check back here for updates and progress!

In the meantime, check out the following [link](https://t.e2ma.net/webview/knaksw/bdf9759bfc14744a47efde8e9370689d) to one of the first international exhibitions to freedom fighter Moses Roper - currently on display in Florida. I was so honoured to be a part of this. Check out the interactive map of Roper's speaking locations, and the plans to hopefully erect a heritage marker to Roper where he was enslaved. 

I've also worked on the following exhibitions in the past:

1) "Black Abolitionists in Victorian Britain." London TBA, (2021).

2) "Henson and Morley: An Interracial Friendship", part of the Journey to Justice Travelling Exhibition, National Justice Museum (2017)

3) "Frederick Douglass", African American History Museum, Boston U.S. (2016)
