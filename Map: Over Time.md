### Map: Over Time

Over the last 8 years, I've experimented with a few different maps to try and visualize African American lecturing tours in Britain and Ireland. (Thanks to Mike Gardner, Uni of Nottingham who has been instrumental in guiding me through this.)

In 2020, I've created a few maps in Carto. While the majority of people I speak to prefer my older maps, with the specific number of lectures in a region and the venue/date info, I still think these Carto maps are really interesting and can give us a fresh perspective on their travels, their routes of transportation, and how far they travelled. See below for a map with their lectures.

Carto has been really useful for creating a map over time: below, you'll see an animated graphic of the number of lectures between 1837 and 1900 by 26 African Americans. Each coloured dot represents a particular person, so the green dots are Moses Roper and the purple dots are James Watkins. While the majority of African Americans travelled to Britain and Ireland in the 1840s, 1850s and 1860s, they continued to lecture in the British Isles long after slavery was legally abolished in 1865. They spoke about segregation, racism, Jim Crow laws, lynching, white domestic terrorism and tried to convince the transatlantic public that, in the words of Bishop Walter Hawkins in 1891, "slavery was not dead. It is alive at this very moment."

Using Carto, I've also created a heat map, showing how lectures were often concentrated in London, the Midlands and parts of Scotland.
